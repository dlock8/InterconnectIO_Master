# First TestStation InterconnectIO SCPI firmware

The complete FTS project is documented on a github website:  https://dlock8.github.io/FTS_Website/

On this deposit, we have the firmware used to create the Master Pico load to control the interconnectIO board.

The hardware support for the firmware is on github location: https://github.com/dlock8/InterconnectIO_Board


The Master Pico software is the earth of interconnectIO board. The software receive SCPI command from the serial port, 
execute the action requested by the command and return answer to the user.

## Project setup

This project has been developped on raspberry pi 4 following installation instruction from this pdf [getting-started-with-pico_C.pdf](./documentation/getting-started-with-pico_C.pdf),  a copy of the pdf is located on the main folder.
Visual studio has been used for developpment and rasberry pi 4 for Pico debug.  

Initially based on https://github.com/cronologic-de/webusb, the project has elvoved to be a complete SCPI instrument 
without frontend interface (next phase).

The compilation is performed using Visual Studio and the extension installed are:

* Cmake v0.0.17
* Cmake Tools v1.20.10
* Cortex-Debug v1.12.1
* debug-tracker-vscode v0.0.15
* Doxygen Documentation Generator v1.4.0
* Doxygen runner v1.8.0
* Github Pull Request v0.96.0
* Hex Editor v1.10.0
* MemoryView v0.0.25
* Periheral Viewer v1.4.6
* RTOS view v0.0.7
* C/C++ v1.21.6

I not sure if all extensions are required but is the one installed presently.


## Building

Build of this cmake project is performed with Visual Studio

## Development

* [`master.c`](master.c) is the main source file for the firmware.
* [`CMakeLists.txt`](CMakeLists.txt) contains build instructions for CMake, including how to build the SCPI library.
* [`pico_sdk_import.cmake`](pico_sdk_import.cmake) was (as usual) copied verbatim from the Pico SDK and allows CMake to interact with the SDKâ€™s functionality.

## Installation

* The Files master.uf2 contains the firmware to be loaded on the Pico RP2040 board using USB cable and boot button.
* When software loaded, the Pico board should be installed on the location marked MASTER on interconnectIO Board.
* On board Pico Led will flash slowly (heartbeat) on power ON.
* Loading master.uf2 will trigger the watchdog, resulting in a burst of beeps during the boot sequence to signal the watchdog timeout. Only cycling the power ON/OFF will reset the watchdog trigger flag.

## Beep code

The boot sequence performs basic diagnostics. A failure in the tests will result in a burst of beeps. The error codes are as follows:

*   1 Beep Burst:  Master Pico's temperature is too high 
*   2 Beep Burst:   Master Pico's system voltage (VSYS) is out of limits
*   3 Beep Burst:    Error in the internal I2C communication
*   4 Beep Burst:    Error reading parameters from I2C EEPROM; default values will be used
*   5 Beep Burst:    A watchdog timeout has occurred on the Master Pico. 



## SCPI command supported by the InterconnectIO Board

The main communication for the InterconnectIO Board is based on the SCPI standard, developed by Jan Breuer [https://www.jaybee.cz/scpi-parser/]. According to the SCPI standard, some commands are mandatory, while others can be developed by the designer. In this section, we provide a list of the required SCPI commands as well as those developed specifically to control the InterconnectIO Board.

## Relay numbering scheme

    Relay bank 1   Differential: 10 @ 17    Single: 100 @ 107 (High) 108 @ 115 (Low)    
    Relay bank 2   Differential: 20 @ 27    Single: 200 @ 215 (High) 208 @ 215 (Low) 
    Relay bank 3   Differential: 30 @ 37    Single: 300 @ 315 (High) 308 @ 315 (Low) 
    Relay bank 4   Differential: 40 @ 47    Single: 400 @ 415 (High) 108 @ 415 (Low) 

* Relay type are DPDT (Double Pole Double Throw). Relay could be connected in differential mode or configured in single ended mode
* Relay address used reflect the difference between the differential and single mode.
* Relay @10, @100 and @108 are the same physical relay.  
* If relay @10 is closed, the high side of the relay (BK1_CH0_H) will be connected on high side of the common point (BK1_COM_H). The low side of the relay (BK1_CH0_L) will be connected on the low side of the common point (BK1_COM_L)
* If relay @100 is closed, the high side of the relay (BK1_CH0_H) will be connected on high side of the common point (BK1_COM_H). The low side of the relay (BK1_CH0_L) will be connected on the low side of the common point (BK1_COM_L)
*   If relay @108 is closed, the high side of the relay (BK1_CH0_H) will be connected on low side of the common point (BK1_COM_L) because the reverse relay will be actuated on the same time of the relay @108. The low side of the relay (BK1_CH0_L) will be connected on the high side of the common point (BK1_COM_H)
* The 4 relay banks are identical and follow the same rules
